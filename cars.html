I have had only minor issues with my car since I purchased it several years ago, and that has made me quite happy for quite some time. </p><p>I am not an auto mechanic. I work with computers and gadgets. I am somewhat clumsy with fiddly things, and tend to end up breaking things while fixing them. I have managed to work through some projects from time to time using YouTube videos and various forum posts around the Internet to assist me in doing things that I don't normally need to do. Fixing plumbing in a house, or doing minor electrical work generally don't cause me much stress. Any time I need to do something to fix my car, it makes me super anxious. I really don't know what I am doing, and if I cause more damage, then me trying to fix it myself to save money becomes a massive failboat leading to me needing to spend money that I don't have.</p><p>About a year or so ago, I started having some issues with the car misfiring. The issue started as a barely noticeable little hiccup in power, most noticeable when just cruising at speed. Nothing major, just a blip here and there. That blip got worse and worse until it really started being troublesome. Doing a bit of research lead me to replacing the coil packs (they sit on the spark plugs, and make them spark). I couldn't afford to have a mechanic replace the parts, and the parts that I found that were original equipment were really expensive. At the time that it happened, I really needed a car, so I ordered some cheap replacements, watched some videos about it, and got them replaced. That was actually super easy, and made me feel good when that did fix the issue.</p><p>Around the start of the lovely year of fail (2020), I started having issues again with misfiring. I replaced the coil packs with cheap ones again because I had to have my car to do what I was doing for income, and was really broke. Again, it worked, and I was happy. Around the beginning of July, it started again :(</p><p>I ordered one original equipment coil pack since my trouble code reader showed just one cylinder out of four was having issues. I knew I should replace them all, but I was going to do one per week or so as I could afford them. Before I ordered the part, my poor car started acting way worse. It was misfiring, but hardcore, and nearly stalled out on my way home from a store. </p><p>I did some research, and found that there were a few possible reasons for the issue I was having. I like to go from cheap to expensive in my repairs if possible, so I got some spark plugs, and a coil pack. I don't have many tools for doing manly things, so I had to order a spark plug socket. After replacing the plugs, it was still not working properly. With shipping, and diagnosing things, it took a couple of weeks to get all of that done. There were a couple more things that could be causing the issue, and I decided to go for the more expensive of the options, but the one that should theoretically cause me to take less of my engine apart since the thought of doing that at all terrifies me.</p><p>I decided that I was going to replace the fuel injectors. The video on YouTube of someone with my exact year and model of car made it look difficult, but doable. The injectors I could get refurbished for a third of the price of new, so I had to go for that option. I ordered the parts, and waited for a decent enough day where it wasn't going to cook me in 100 degree F heat and high humidity. </p><p>I was able to get almost everything taken apart that I needed to. Almost everything. In this case, almost isn't nearly good enough. There was a single bolt holding the intake manifold onto the engine that I just could not see to get a socket onto. I tried contorting in many different ways, I tried a flashlight to help see, but I couldn't get to it. I thought maybe my tools weren't quite able to reach, so I bought a socket accessory kit. I took my new accessory kit, and an old action camera on a stick out to see if I could get the bolt off. NOPE.JPG</p><p>I called the mechanic that I have used before to see what it could cost to have the injectors replaced because I just couldn't get to them even though you can see them without taking anything off of the engine to begin with. They said that they would not use my parts, and that they could only get new ones. I can't afford that at all. I was going to have to have my car towed in and have them replace one of the four injectors, which I didn't want to do at all. It made no sense to replace one if you had to take most of the engine apart to get there. </p><p>There we were at almost the end of July. I hadn't had a working car in weeks, and had been relying on Instacart (which I delivered for for years) and Shipt to get me groceries and cat supplies. I was resigned to having my car in the shop as soon as I could figure out how I was going to pay for it. I decided to try one more thing before I did that.</p><p>I ordered a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086X5N5S9/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_EL1kFb3M1QRBZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">borescope </a>from Amazon that comes with a screen that would hopefully let me see where the bolt was so that I could get to it. Today was the day that I decided to do the thing that I need to do, and the borescope was exactly what I needed. I was so excited when I was able to get everything taken off that I needed to, and was presented with a direct view of the fuel rail and injectors, which is what the photo is at the top of the post. Putting the new injectors in was a piece of cake at that point. Getting the car back together again was insanely not cake like at all, and ruined my body for the rest of the day (I am so sore everywhere). </p><p>Finally! I could hopefully drive to Costco today, or another place that I haven't been to in a few weeks... Insert key, turn, NOTHING HAPPENED. I had a diagnostic tool attached to the car since the trouble started, and that killed the battery dead. But I have a portable jump starter! You only get one try to get the car running with this jump starter before you have to disconnect it and reconnect to try again if needed. It was needed. Several times. Opps, I found a vacuum line that wasn't attached, and I attached it. I tried to start it again, and it did start!</p><p>It was running just as horribly as when I parked it a month ago. </p><p>I remembered that I had the one new coil pack that I hadn't installed yet, and figured that I may as well replace it because I had it, and I wanted to have good parts on there if I could. I popped the new pack on, and the car wouldn't start. The battery hadn't had enough time to really charge up when I had started the car earlier. I came in, grabbed the jumpstarter, and got one attempt from it before it died. </p><p>I charged it all day, and went out this evening to try again. The damn jumpstarter is just erroring whenever I connect it to the car now, and is useless. Since I have had it for a while, I figured I would order a new one because I need to try something before throwing in the towel and taking it to the mechanic.</p><p>Hopefully a bit of a boost will get it up and running again. There is one more service that is on the list of possible fixes, and I don't want to do it at all as it requires taking even more of the engine apart and futzing with the internals. </p><p>While I love learning new things and acquiring new skills, I really don't enjoy working on my car. Being able to just take your car into the shop when something happens to it is a foreign concept to me, and I am glad that I have been this fortunate for this long with what I own.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 5, 2020</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://mrfreshy.github.io/mrfreshy.github.io/authors/mrfreshy/" class="invert" rel="author">MrFreshy</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://mrfreshy.github.io/mrfreshy.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://mrfreshy.github.io/mrfreshy.github.io/google-it.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Google it!</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright &copy; 2020 MrFreshy.</div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://mrfreshy.github.io/mrfreshy.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
