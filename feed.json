For some reason, making websites has never made lot of sense to me. I have never wanted to take the time to learn how to code a site. </p>\n<p>There have been multiple attempts at using this tool or that tool, but even this far into the timeline of websites being a thing, it still isn't EASY. WYSIWYG editing is supposed to make it simple to make what you look at as you design into a presentable website. Every attempt I have made over the years has ended up an exercise in frustration and an abandoned project.</p>\n<p>Getting text posted up seems easy enough, but adding a photo can be maddening. I don't get it, and don't actually want to get it. There are not many topics that I actively just don't want to know, but this is one of them. </p>\n<p>All of that being blah'd, here I am again with an attempt at making something happen. I am using a tool that seems to be okay, but we shall see once I attempt to add an image here and then publish.</p>",
