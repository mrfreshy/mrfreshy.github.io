For some reason, making websites has never made lot of sense to me. I have never wanted to take the time to learn how to code a site. </p><p>There have been multiple attempts at using this tool or that tool, but even this far into the timeline of websites being a thing, it still isn't EASY. WYSIWYG editing is supposed to make it simple to make what you look at as you design into a presentable website. Every attempt I have made over the years has ended up an exercise in frustration and an abandoned project.</p><p>Getting text posted up seems easy enough, but adding a photo can be maddening. I don't get it, and don't actually want to get it. There are not many topics that I actively just don't want to know, but this is one of them. </p><p>All of that being blah'd, here I am again with an attempt at making something happen. I am using a tool that seems to be okay, but we shall see once I attempt to add an image here and then publish.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 29, 2020</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://mrfreshy.github.io/mrfreshy.github.io/authors/mrfreshy/" class="invert" rel="author">MrFreshy</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://mrfreshy.github.io/mrfreshy.github.io/google-it.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Google it! </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://mrfreshy.github.io/mrfreshy.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://mrfreshy.github.io/mrfreshy.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
