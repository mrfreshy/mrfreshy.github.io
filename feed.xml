<p>There are communities online surrounding pretty much any subject that you can think of. These places can be a wonderful place for like-minded people to gather to share information about a particular subject. These places (various subreddits, hashtags on Twitter, even facebook groups) sometimes enable a fringe interest to survive or even thrive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in a lot of cases there is a barrier to entry to the community that you are wanting access to. "Gatekeeping" is something that is mentioned frequently, and it can take different forms. In the tech areas, one of the most popular forms of gatekeeping is to tell someone to "Google it". When a new person wants to become part of a community, or at least wants to feel it out to see if it fits them, being told to find their own answers can be very off-putting and may lead them to abandon their interest. </p>
<p>In a lot of cases, especially in more advanced or esoteric subjects, telling someone to find their own answers can be nearly insurmountable due to one thing that most subjects have that creates a barrier to entry whether intentional or not - jargon. Someone with great Google skills will still fail if they have no idea what they are searching for. A lot of times a newbie needs a push toward what to search for. I don't like to find the information for someone if I can help it, but I like to nudge them in the right direction so that they can help themselves in the future. </p>
<p>A lot of times, people are gatekeepers without really realizing it because they forget that people that are new to their domain really don't know anything about it. Some communities gatekeep more than others, and I don't know if it is more intentional in some subjects than others, but it feels like DIY car and home communities are more inviting to new people than tech-focused ones are. </p>
<p>Everybody was new sometime. Some questions can be annoying after answering them for the eleventybillionth time, but if you love what you are interested in, and you want that interest to thrive and survive long-term, help the noobs learn how to help themselves. Create a FAQ for your community if you can and point people to that to help push people toward helping themselves. Take a look at what you are doing and how you are providing things every now and again to see if anything changed or needs to be changed. Don't assume that you are working with a dummy just because they don't know what a common term is because it isn't common until it is.</p>

<p>I have been involved with tech pretty deeply over multiple decades, and have at times wanted to have a place to post up my thoughts about random topics. For some reason, making websites has never made lot of sense to me. I have never wanted to take the time to learn how to code a site. </p>
<p>There have been multiple attempts at using this tool or that tool, but even this far into the timeline of websites being a thing, it still isn't EASY. WYSIWYG editing is supposed to make it simple to make what you look at as you design into a presentable website. Every attempt I have made over the years has ended up an exercise in frustration and an abandoned project.</p>
<p>Getting text posted up seems easy enough, but adding a photo can be maddening. I don't get it, and don't actually want to get it. There are not many topics that I actively just don't want to know, but this is one of them. </p>
<p>All of that being blah'd, here I am again with an attempt at making something happen. I am using a tool that seems to be okay, but we shall see once I attempt to add an image here and then publish.</p>
